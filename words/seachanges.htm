  <p>
  I am what I am<br>
  but that's not all I can be<br>
  When looking within<br>
  many changes plain to see</p>

  <p>
  But just as the sea changes<br>
  so the tides will turn within<br>
  When looking for that higher ground<br>
  beneath this sullen skin</p>

  <p>
  I promise that I won't look up<br>
  until the sun is high<br>
  I'll never count the steps I took<br>
  I wouldn't want to try</p>

  <p>
  And even if to me tomorrow<br>
  the same toil brings<br>
  You'll find that I'm still nigh the first<br>
  prisoner who sings</p>
