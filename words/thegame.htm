<p align="center">It's always a question of who's involved in the game.<br>
  The players are playing,<br>
  others wish they could do the same.<br>
  Hey baby what's up?<br>
  Can I talk to you, what's your name?<br>
  Just thought I'd try<br>
  to take advantage of this little time-frame.<br>
  Do you think my spark is enough<br>
  to turn your chill into a flame?<br>
  You're starting to laugh<br>
  but that wasn't really my aim.<br>
  Sure I like to see you smile<br>
  but the look is telling me I'm lame.<br>
  If I can stand I'll walk away,<br>
  to find another who won't<br>
  try to make me feel like I'm to blame<br>
  for the problems they're having<br>
  making the tigers of the world tame.</p>
