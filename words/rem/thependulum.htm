<p>These days I spend most of my time<br/>
clinging desperately to the weight<br/>
at the end of a giant pendulum</p>

<p>In brief moments of clarity I release<br/>
the weight only to find I am bound<br/>
to it by invisible threads anyway</p>

<p>all that effort for nothing</p>

<p>At the low point<br/>
the pressure is unbearable<br/>
it's all I can do to breathe</p>

<p>Forcing the blood from my brain<br/>
I go mostly deaf, partly blind, frequently mute<br/>
losing touch with my own heartbeat</p>

<p>You're advised to keep a safe distance -<br/>
we can never be too sure if this will be the time<br/>
it finally unhinges and spins wildly out of control</p>

<p>But, oh, the high points<br/>
Motionless. Weightless.<br/>
Immortal in the only meaningful sense of the word</p>

<p>The revelry isn't bad either<br/>
and I can be quite indulgent<br/>
but rent is a bitch when the bills come due</p>

<p>you never think about debt until it is staring you in the face</p>

<p>This metaphor is a fairy tale I spun for myself<br/>
to make my life seem more meaningful<br/>
or important somehow</p>

<p>I need to be at the center of my story<br/>
and struggle is the greatest plot point of all<br/>
So I say, pile it on!</p>

<p>To this end I have invented some characters<br/>
to help move the story along, keep things interesting<br/>
and, you know, struggle with</p>

<p>The one I am fondest of is a giant mascot<br/>
shaped like a vagina<br/>
who comes to visit me at night</p>

<p>About this curious character,<br/>
I was telling you how she always<br/>
changes shape right before my eyes</p>

<p>At first she appears in her natural ambience<br/>
warm, moist, pink<br/>
inviting like a mother's doorstep</p>

<p>I move closer and extend my hand<br/>
in a friendly gesture<br/>
of welcome and manipulation</p>

<p>she's not the only one with games to play</p>

<p>In the beginning we get along fine<br/>
we seem to go together<br/>
like peas in a pod or hotdog and bun</p>

<p>But before long the freedom and sense of adventure<br/>
which lubricated our friendship<br/>
and prevented friction has dried up</p>

<p>In fact the whole damn costume is shriveling<br/>
developing cracks with pieces flaking off<br/>
like leprosy</p>

<p>What is revealed beneath has none of the charm<br/>
and it oozes a dark fluid<br/>
that smells of rotting flesh</p>

<p>the process only accelerates if you foolishly speak of it aloud</p>

<p>It continues like this for some time<br/>
until the sun begins to light the distant horizon<br/>
and I can finally get a look at my muse</p>

<p>It's not a pretty picture by this point<br/>
but the wreckage is unavoidable and we haven't even<br/>
dealt with the futility of our arrangement yet</p>

<p>Before noon we've parted ways<br/>
and the dream of last night's charades<br/>
already fades under the strain of a throbbing sun</p>

<p>We were victims of inevitability<br/>
like so many layers of paint<br/>
stripped and bleached out</p>

<p>the point is, like all fairy tales, it's a lie.</p>

<p>This might be obvious from the description<br/>
but the mind is a funny thing<br/>
and it's best trick is tricking itself</p>

<p>The allure of a rhythmic cycle<br/>
with its predictable turns<br/>
steadily swinging in my head</p>

<p>Comforts me through the downswing<br/>
calming my fevered revulsions<br/>
minimizing collateral damage</p>

<p>All the while ensuring that my glory<br/>
retains its ephemeral exuberance<br/>
which was the allure all along</p>

<p>I imagine the motion creating a vibration<br/>
striking a note in eternity<br/>
bringing me a bit more of the immortality I crave</p>

<p>if there's one thing I can't stand it's monotony</p>
