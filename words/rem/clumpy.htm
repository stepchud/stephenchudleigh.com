<div class="content">what's to become of the wonderful stump?<br>
  the wad that shot out during a hump<br>
  to find it's mate and begin to clump<br>
  upon the wall
  <p>it grew and sneezed but who'd have guessed<br>
    which way t'would turn when it left the nest<br>
    and had to walk a path apart from 'momma knows best'<br>
    but first to crawl</p>
