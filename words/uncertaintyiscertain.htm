<p align="center">Uncertainty is certain<br>
  Of this we need not doubt<br>
  &quot;Right&quot;-hidden by a curtain<br>
  Left veiled and shaded out </p>
<p align="center">Frustration is my recourse<br>
  Solitude is my guide<br>
  Justification lacking<br>
  It's no wonder i hide</p>
<p align="center">This offers little peace(s)<br>
  An island washed by tide<br>
  Pieces of the puzzle<br>
  Find each other side by side</p>
<p align="center">Who put them there? i wonder<br>
  This one does not belong<br>
  So fitting is my blunder?<br>
  I don't know what went wrong</p>
<p align="center">Confusion is a law, friend<br>
  Which language hardly cures<br>
  Words and meanings different (insult or compliment?)<br>
  Interpretation yours</p>
<p align="center">Some reach out to god for help<br>
  Others education<br>
  While some may find no comfort<br>
  Death answers their question</p>
<p align="center">But we will press on; my hope<br>
  A dream of guiding light<br>
  Sure to fix the knotted rope<br>
  Reason shines banishing night</p>
<p align="center">Take root this precious seedling<br>
  Grow, expand, flourish, rise<br>
  Newly defined breeding<br>
  Uncover all my eyes</p>
