<div class="poem text">
  Returning (returning) to the spot that is the furthest from the Sun<br>
  Is it a mystery that we forget just what we've always done<br>
  So frantically searching for the next place to run<br>
  Not knowing it's the same<br>
  that nothing has changed<br>
  Stumbling in the dark having forgotten the One<br>
  We please ourselves again; what else is there but fun?</p>
