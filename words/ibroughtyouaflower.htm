<div class="poem text">
  I brought you a flower<br>
  You threw it back at me<br>
  It wasn't the right color
  <p>
  I brought you dinner<br>
  You looked me in the eye<br>
  And fed it to your dog</p>
  <p>
  Here, take these cd's<br>
  This one has our song<br>
  I didn't know they were flammable</p>
  <p>
  Here's a letter, dear,<br>
  The only way for me to tell you<br>
  Because my jaw is still swollen</p>
  <p>
  You really do look pretty<br>
  I wasn't lying. I'm sorry,<br>
  But I'm not your father</p>
