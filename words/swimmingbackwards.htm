<p>Perched precariously<br>
  Overlooking a world<br>
  Of my own creation </p>
<p>Hoping seriously<br>
  That in some way<br>
  It would all be worthwhile</p>
<p>Thinking previously<br>
  What might have been<br>
  If only I'd started sooner</p>
<p>Knowing ultimately<br>
  It doesn't matter because<br>
  The river will not stop flowing</p>
<p>Nor can one swim up the waterfall</p>
