  &quot;and how 'bout you?&quot;<br>
  the teacher impatiently taps her foot
<p>her student frowns,<br>
  and tries to hide behind the book</p>
<p>&quot;well this won't do<br>
  come over here and let me have a look&quot;</p>
<p>her student feels ashamed<br>
  she never written nothing good</p>
<p>the classroom watches<br>
  as tears appear on her sullen face</p>
<p>&quot;i can't you wouldn't<br>
  like it. god i hate this place!&quot;</p>
<p>she tears it up and makes a move<br>
  toward the open door</p>
<p>prepared for this,<br>
  the class clown shows her what he's got in store</p>
<p>she didn't see the foot<br>
  and now she's sprawled across the floor</p>
