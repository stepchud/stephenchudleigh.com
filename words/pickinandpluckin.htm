<div class="poem text">
  I went out pickin' and pluckin'<br>
  Makin a ruckus to find where my mind was<br>
  Sleepin the time in and makin it timeless<br>
  Releasin the slime 'n just stakin a claim on<br>
  The same old thang that was strikin me<br>
  Off key but still there was harmony
  <p>
  It takes a little more but the score will be settled<br>
  As long as my time isn't wasted I'm livin and tastin<br>
  The worst of the cravin's have gone into hibernation<br>
  But that's just because</p>
  <p>
  You made sure to leave us with a mysterious<br>
  Appraisal to praise until consternation was raised<br>
  And the slaves had gone home<br>
  All tired from gnawin the meat to tha bone<br>
  And that's why I love you God</p>
