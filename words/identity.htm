  <p>Lord, make thyself known to me<br>
    For to me, a real sign of thee would surely take more than mere thunder</p>
  <p>Lord, resurrect me<br>
    For to me, to be found in the ground, I'd surely prefer to stay under</p>
  <p>Lord, make use of me<br>
    For to me, to be used by thee, would surely be thought a blunder</p>
  <p>Lord, identify with me<br>
    For to me, identity with thee has surely been cast asunder</p>
