<div class="poem text">
  Takin the bus home it stops along the way<br>
  Some people get off to greet the ending of the day<br>
  I catch a pair of eyes before they look the other way<br>
  She flashes a smile but I don't have words to say<br>
  It's happened before, thoughts pulling me away<br>
  Part of me moves but something else will make me stay<br>
  At least I could have smiled<br>
  What kind of game is that to play<br>
  I'm already home before the memory will fade<br>
  It's better to lose than fold a hand that could have played
