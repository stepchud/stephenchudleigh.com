<div class="poem text">
  I'd like to know the story within,<br>
  Past bones, flesh, skin but where to begin?</p>
  <p>
  And where, after all, does my desire lie<br>
  Brain, mind, soul or mystical third eye?</p>
  <p>
  The questions are strange but certainly real<br>
  What is it that causes emotions I feel?</p>
  <p>
  And which is the 'I' that I take as a given<br>
  How many more I's to the same answers striven?</p>
  <p>
  On to more questions the rabbit hole hides<br>
  Circling, spiralling, falling inside</p>
  <p>
  Loving the journey, resenting the path<br>
  At times feeling certain, if only of math</p>
  <p>
  <em>&quot;Damn you Old Man!&quot;</em>, the adventurer growls<br>
  Awakened at night by owls - and coyote howls</p>
  <p>
  It could have been shorter and easier too<br>
  I should have been born seeing only what's True</p>
  <p>
  Instead I learned language and soon how to lie<br>
  So now I'm confused and can only ask Why?</p>
