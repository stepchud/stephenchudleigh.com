<p>You go your way, I'll go mine<br>
  And we'll pretend that we're just fine<br>
  With time you may get back your mind<br>
  You haven't even reached your prime </p>
<p>I'm sure I'll think that's how it goes<br>
  And play it off like noone knows<br>
  Just how I killed what always grows<br>
  You should have met me at the shows</p>
<p>Instead we played our games and lost<br>
  But who can count an unknown cost</p>
