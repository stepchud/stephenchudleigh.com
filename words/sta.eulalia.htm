<p align="center">You are in my dreams<br>
  but I have not seen you.<br>
  I gave you my heart because<br>
  I could not stay. </p>
<p align="center">Now we are far apart,<br>
  but I can not forget.<br>
  You shared yourself with me<br>
  and it changed my outlook.</p>
<p align="center">I can not look at another<br>
  without seeing your face.<br>
  You gave me hope<br>
  and now I believe.</p>
<p align="center">Tomorrow it will be the same,<br>
  time passes slowly.<br>
  One day we will meet again<br>
  but I can not say what will happen.</p>
<p align="center">Will we be happy? Will we cry?<br>
  Can I hold you like I did<br>
  on the beach at Sta. Eulalia?<br>
  Or will you shake my hand?</p>
