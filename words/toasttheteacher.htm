<p align="center">I propose a toast<br>
  to those still living<br>
  who find the most<br>
  unselfish giving </p>
<p align="center">Or him who makes it his one wish<br>
  to teach another how to fish<br>
  and enlisting all his skills<br>
  to serve the starving meals</p>
<p align="center">They might not notice at the time<br>
  they may complain &quot;where is my wine?&quot;<br>
  for men are difficult to please,<br>
  untrusting, <em>what's in it for me?</em></p>
<p align="center">And yet, in face of jealousy<br>
  resentment, sloth and greed<br>
  she goes on, planting the seed<br>
  because she sees that others need.</p>
