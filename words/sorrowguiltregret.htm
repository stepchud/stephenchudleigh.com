<div class="poem text">
  I wish I could explain<br>
  The way your light attracts.<br>
  If I had half a brain,<br>
  I'd stand and face the facts.<br>
  But three times yesterday<br>
  I thought about the tracks,<br>
  And how we'd dare the train<br>
  And how we'd dare the train.
  <p>Sorrow, guilt, regret,<br>
  I have some new friends now.<br>
  Ok you keep the pet<br>
  She's a bitch anyhow.<br>
  Tossing, turning, sweat,<br>
  Even sleep will not allow<br>
  There's just too much to get<br>
  There's not enough to get</p>
  <p>
  I don't get it.</p>
