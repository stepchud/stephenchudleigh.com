<div class="poem text">
  someday, you'll find a solution<br>
  someday, you'll actually try<br>
  excuses now are illusions<br>
  someday, you'll understand why</p>
  <p>
  someday, you'll love your neighbors<br>
  by then it won't seem such a curse<br>
  ... maybe enjoy your labors<br>
  considering what could be worse</p>
  <p>
  someday, you'll understand your religion<br>
  instead of just saying &quot;It's True!&quot;<br>
  but today don't trouble yourself much<br>
  you've more important things to do</p>
  <p>
  someday, that won't sound like derision<br>
  you'll use it instead for your gain<br>
  but you've always had a decision:<br>
  accept love or find in it pain</p>
