  Everything is Possible<br>
  only to him who tries.<br>
  Young birds all have to grow up<br>
  before they ever fly.
  <p>
  And flying your first, above the trees<br>
  what did you happen to see?<br>
  Abilities you never knew<br>
  were YOUR possibility.</p>
  <p>
  That's what it takes - effort, will -<br>
  to learn what life can teach.<br>
  it takes some time, but then you'll know<br>
  what's possible's in reach.</p>
  <p>
  Our lives are surely to the birds,<br>
  or frogs or bugs or sheep.<br>
  The gift you get from feeling that<br>
  isn't given, neither cheap.</p>
  <p>
  So ask yourself, if in your life,<br>
  you've tried with all of your might,<br>
  To be the bird who got the worm,<br>
  and grew 'til his first flight.</p>
