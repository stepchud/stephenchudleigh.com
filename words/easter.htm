<div class="poem text">
  This is not for you<br>
  an honest assertion made possible through<br>
  ears, eyes and the adding of one and one, too
  <p>
  Contemptible embrace of fallacy<br>
  your contradictions know they see<br>
  the end of other possibilities</p>
  <p>
  and by opposing end them<br>
  (or by opposing are them?)</p>
  <p>
  Take your most recent attempt<br>
  a breeding ground, but me exempt<br>
  by the last day of Lent</p>
  <p>
  An inventory of famous lies<br>
  often accompanied by flies or lines<br>
  of heredity consumed by size</p>
  <p>
  Does a blackhole know it ate?<br>
  can you, by threat, me animate?</p>
  <p>
  Or might I offer warm embrace?<br>
  and you accept it, saving face?</p>
  <p>
  I can not know which way you lean,<br>
  and you may stretch me to extreme<br>
  but this won't burn by gasoline,<br>
  nor mechanical imagined dream</p>
  <p>
  I take that back, you are my friend<br>
  I'm the grass, you are the wind<br>
  and I, to your will, may bend.<br>
  The End.</p>
