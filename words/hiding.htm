<p>I was hiding....<br>
  from you....<br>
  and it took a lot of strength<br>
  to cover what I knew.<br>
  The thing about hiding,<br>
  well there's a few,<br>
  it's kind of seductive,<br>
  but never true.<br>
</p>
<p>When I see me<br>
  turning away,<br>
  I'm satisfied as if<br>
  the night conquers day.<br>
  Like we're both saved<br>
  it's a curious fate.<br>
  needs were ignored<br>
  egos to satiate.<br>
  I'm-a-little-better<br>
  or maybe it's worse<br>
  but you'll never know<br>
  either blessing or curse.<br>
  If you thank me I'll kiss you<br>
  small effort re-imbursed.<br>
