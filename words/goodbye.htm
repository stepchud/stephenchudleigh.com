<div class="poem title">Goodbye</div>
<div class="poem text">
  I had a dream<br>
  and you were there<br>
  we played a game<br>
  of sit and stare</p>
  <p>
  I rose to leave<br>
  you on the floor<br>
  I cannnot play<br>
  this anymore</p>
  <p>
  You'll try again tomorrow but<br>
  I won't sit down with you</p>
  <p>
  You'll have to calm your sorrow, cut<br>
  your ties with feeling blue</p>
  <p>
  How many times<br>
  we've played this game<br>
  it always ended<br>
  up the same</p>
  <p>
  I cannot help you if you're lame<br>
  to stand and walk the only choice</p>
  <p>
  But you've been paralyzed by games<br>
  and noone's ever heard your voice</p>
  <p>
  Which makes it easier for me<br>
  to leave and not look back<br>
  Goodbye</p>
