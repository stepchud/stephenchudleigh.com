<div class="poem text">
  I get so tired sometimes of everything evaporating<br>
  It's like a curse to witness it lose force and fade away<br>
  All because it couldn't find a stable place to make a home<br>
  It's worse knowing that it was no one's fault but my own<br>
  This is madness I say to make it seem more romantic<br>
  The difficulty wasn't in realization but remembrance
