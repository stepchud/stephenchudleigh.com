  <p>You go your way, I'll go mine<br>
    and we'll pretend that we're just fine<br>
    with time you may get back your mind<br>
    you haven't even reached your prime</p>
  <p>i'm sure i'll think that's how it goes<br>
    and play it off like noone knows<br>
    just how i killed what always grows<br>
    you should have met me at the shows</p>
  <p>instead we played our games and lost<br>
    but who can count an unknown cost</p>
