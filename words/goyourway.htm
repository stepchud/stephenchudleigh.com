<div class="poem text">
  You go your way, I'll go mine<br>
  and we'll pretend that we're just fine<br>
  with time you may get back your mind<br>
  you haven't even reached your prime</p>
  <p>
  I'm sure I'll think that's how it goes<br>
  and play it off like noone knows<br>
  just how I killed what always grows<br>
  you should have met me at the shows</p>
  <p>
  Instead we played our games and lost<br>
  but who can count an unknown cost</p>
