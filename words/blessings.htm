<p align="center">We may never know the path we travel down in life<br>
  The road is sometimes bumpy and we think it&#8217;s filled with strife</p>
<p align="center">We never know everything so our answer&#8217;s never sure<br>
  But isn&#8217;t that the way if someone seeks for something pure</p>
<p align="center">In my life all I&#8217;ve found is that I can not own a thing<br>
  Because of this I&#8217;ve learned to let go and let life be my swing</p>
<p align="center">The only thing I want is someone to sit next to me<br>
  To laugh and cry and finally learn how to let things be</p>
<p align="center">And so I&#8217;ve given up everything else I thought I had<br>
  Everything but you, my love, have only made me sad</p>
<p align="center">And missing you the sadness turned from hope into a curse<br>
  In silence I would sit and wait for my turn in the hearse</p>
<p align="center">But yesterday I saw the folly of my silent sitting plan<br>
  If you never knew, then you would find another man</p>
<p align="center">Because I wasn&#8217;t man enough to admit what I knew<br>
  I can&#8217;t turn back, I can&#8217;t erase it, just know: I love you.</p>
