Everything is Possible
only to him who tries.
Young birds all have to grow up
before they ever fly.

And flying your first, above the trees
what did you happen to see?
Abilities you never knew
were YOUR possibility.

That's what it takes - effort, will -
to learn what life can teach.
it takes some time, but then you'll know
what's possible's in reach.

Our lives are surely to the birds,
or frogs or bugs or sheep.
The gift you get from feeling that
isn't given, neither cheap.

So ask yourself,if in your life,
you've tried with all of your might?
To be the bird who got the worm,
and grew 'til his first flight.
