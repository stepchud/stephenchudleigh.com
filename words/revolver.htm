<div class="poem text">
  So you try to conform the world<br/>
  But you realize the world will not conform
  <p>
  So you try to understand the workings of the world<br/>
  But you realize you can not understand its complexity</p>
  <p>
  So you try to make your peace with the world<br/>
  But you realize the world can not be trusted</p>
  <p>
  So you try to retire from the world<br/>
  But you realize your very life depends on it</p>
  <p>
  So you try to live in the world<br/>
  But you realize that death has been hunting you since birth</p>
  <p>
  So you carry on without worrying too much about it<br/>
  But you realize that some things are not to your liking</p>
  So you try to conform the world ...
