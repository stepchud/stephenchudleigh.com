  Wouldn't it be so nice
  <p>
  If the weakest of the men<br>
  could get beyond the need<br>
  to prove their strength by<br>
  forcing other people to obey</p>
  <p>
  Then all the little children<br>
  would be free to follow dreams and<br>
  make themselves into the beings<br>
  they were always s'posed to be</p>
  <p>
  Maybe then we could stop dying<br>
  for the chance to simply live<br>
  and stop calling them the heroes<br>
  who prolong the situation</p>
  <p>
  That would be so nice.</p>
