  This page contains some musical arrangements I've messed around with. 
  Keep in mind, I'm barely even an amateur at this. The date next to each link is the last time 
  a change was posted. Unfortunately I have not been able to work on new stuff
  as often as I might like. But I am always working on 'something', so check back in the future for
  the latest and greatest.<br>
  I recently made a <a href="/OctaveIntro2.html" target="_blank">flash movie about the octave</a>.

    <li><a href="/songs/TenaciousDeepDish.mp3"><i>Tenacious Deep Dish</i></a> [02/06/2006] &#8211; 
	  My first Acid Pro music project. I really like this house track (<i>Nothing</i> by 
	  Holden &amp; Thompson, featured on a Deep Dish compilation set) and one day I thought
	  about overlaying some vocals by Tenacious D to see what would happen. There 
          is also a sample taken from the Blackalicious song <i>Clockwork</i> at the beginning.<br>

    <li><a href="/songs/SlidingAround.mp3"><i>Sliding Around</i></a> [02/06/2006] 
          &#8211; I recorded myself on guitar for about 30 minutes, and this is what 
          came out of it. At the time of recording, I had been playing for about 18 months.<br>
    </li>
    <li><a href="/songs/Autumn.mp3"><i>Autumn</i></a> [02/14/2006] &#8211; Same 
          guitar player, improvements to the editing process. 
          Why Autumn? I don't know.<br>
    </li>
    <li><a href="/songs/JustOneRib.mp3"><i>Just One Rib</i></a> [04/28/2006] &#8211;
          My playing has improved some, as this required much less editing.
          Actually this should probably be two or three different songs but
          I just didn't take the time to develop it. Oh well there's always 'someday'. ;-)<br>
