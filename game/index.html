      <h1>The Conscious Videogame</h1>
        This game was originally invented by Russell Smith as a board game called 
        The Conscious Boardgame. It was translated to video game form by Stephen 
        Chudleigh with the permission of Mr. Smith, who retains all rights. The game is written in Java, and requires Java Runtime version 
        1.4.2 or later. See the <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a> to get the game running on your computer.<br>
            Please see the <a href="overview.html">game overview</a> if you are new to this game, as it explains
            the complex rules and concepts.
