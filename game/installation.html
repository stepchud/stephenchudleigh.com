    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>
    Fortunately, this is pretty easy. You need priveleges to install software on your computer.
    If you already have Java version 1.4.2 or newer installed, follow the instructions below to
    Download &amp; Play. Otherwise, you will need to go to the
    <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/" target="_blank">Java download page</a> and get the latest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the Java image below and following their installation instructions.
    </p>
    <div class="javadownload">
      <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/" target="_blank">
        <img width="90" height="120" border="0" style="margin: 8px;" alt="GetJava Download Button" title="GetJava" src="https://www.java.com/ga/images/auto/1371159372900?image=true">

    <h3>Download &amp; Play</h3>
    <p>
      Due to some security updates to Java, the easiest thing to do is download CBGame.jar and play it directly from your computer:
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Right click <a href="/game/CBGame.jar">this link</a>, choose "Save As..."<br>
          <li>Save it to your hard drive, e.g. your Desktop.<br>
          <li>Navigate to that location and double-click the file.<br>
          <li>The game should start but if not, try right-click and choose "Open".<br>
          <li>On a Mac you may get a warning about unidentified developer. That's me.<br>
          <li>Hold down the "Control" key, right-click the file and choose open. Then select "Open" at the confirmation prompt.<br>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Don't worry! This game does not even connect to the internet, much less send your personal data anywhere. Weird, right?<br>
        Please <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> if you have problems starting the game or to report bugs.
